Do you want to help change the trajectory of a child’s life by covering the cost for them to go to college? You can do this for around $15 a month. And 100% of your support goes directly to pay for the child’s college tuition.

$200 per year. Or $17 per month. Or $.55 per day. That is the cost to cover the majority of a student's needs.

The people we minister to are among the very poor and don't have opportunities to pursue an education. We have found that education is the best way to get people out of poverty.
 
We have been providing school supplies to encourage poor children to go to school for the last 28 years. In India there are no fees for public schools from 1st through 10th grade. Families only need to provide school supplies but even that proves impossible for many families.

That is the reason we started with school supplies. It’s been effective and well received and others see it as sharing God’s love.

This ministry has been a tangible way to support the schools in the local communities.

On average we provide school supplies for <strong>over 2,100 kids each year</strong>. Most of the children we support come from our Christian families.

In 2015 we started a sponsorship program to help kids go to college who otherwise would not have the opportunity. Each year the program has grown in popularity from 3 kids in 2015 to 47 kids in 2018. Many of these children have worked hard and received marks with distinction. They desire to continue their education but face enormous odds at financing a college education. Every one of these kids deserve the opportunity to go to college. We're grateful that we get to participate in what God is doing in their lives to reach their full potential.

Are you willing to commit to giving $200 a year for 4 years to change the life of a child and their family forever?

Please pray and see where God leads your heart.
