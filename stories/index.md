There's a story behind every changed life.
These stories capture the heart of our mission.

<p>
Hello,
<br><br>
</p>
<p>
My husband and I have been married for 10 years. It’s important in our culture that a couple has a child within the first 2 years of their marriage. Otherwise the wife gets harassed by the family.
<br><br>
</p>
<p>
My husband and I were unable to have a child and his family blamed me for bringing a curse upon our family. The harassment was bad since we are from a high caste in the Hindu religion.	 My parents took me to many holy shrines to make special sacrifices to our gods. We’ve also gone to specialists in Bangalore to receive fertility treatments.
<br><br>
</p>
<p>
Sadly, nothing seemed to work. Things got so bad that I contemplated committing suicide. My husband and I began having trouble in our marriage.
<br><br>
</p>
<p>
One day a Christian lady from our village pulled me aside and told me about Jesus. She said if we pray God will bless us. I began attending a bible study and prayer meeting in our village. I remember one prayer meeting where our pastor preached about Abraham and Sarah. That was the first night my husband came with me to the prayer meeting. I began to ask God to bless me like He did Abraham and Sarah.
<br><br>
</p>
<p>
That’s around the time I began going to church. I thought the worship was strange but I loved it. The Christian lady started teaching me how to pray and that’s when things began to change.
<br><br>
</p>
<p>
I went to the doctor in October and was told that I was 2 months pregnant.  I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy in July.
<br><br>
</p>
<p>
Our family is from a Hindu High Caste but they allow me to go to church and prayer meeting. We all believe that our baby is a gift from Jesus.  But, they don’t want me to become a Christian and leave Hinduism. Thank you for taking time to read my life story.
